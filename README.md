# Sorting Algorithms and Big O in C

This project entails concepts on:
* Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* Selecting the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* Stable sorting algorithm

#### Programs include:
* 0-bubble\_sort.c - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
* 1-insertion\_sort\_list.c - a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
* 2-selection\_sort.c - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
* 3-quick\_sort.c - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
